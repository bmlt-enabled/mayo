# TODO

- [ ] Ensure that you can't get the subscriber list unauthenticated.
- [ ] Announcement form, akin to mayo_event_form.
- [ ] Multiple emails aren't being sent.

Future considerations: 

- [ ] Consider in the future wp-cron for large lists if it becomes an issue, or suggest people use Post SMTP with whatever exists there.
